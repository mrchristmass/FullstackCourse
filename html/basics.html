        <h1>Interesting is easy!</h1>
        <p>first, we need to learn some basic html</p>
        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define outline of your site</p>
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p> This is you make unordered list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each iteam in its own "li" elemnt</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Inline elements</h4>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a parcticular word of phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
